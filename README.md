# missile-commander-vue
The main goal for this project is test Vue's capability on game design purposes.
It is a basic remake from the '80s shoot 'em up game Missile Command. It's not suposed to have many levels but who knows what can we build.
You can see some info of Missile Coomand in its [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command).

Feel free to pull this project and use it the way it fits you.
I hope you have some fun with it.
